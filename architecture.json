  "cover_prompt": "A young man, his face etched with both grief and determination, carefully places a final, weathered railway sleeper onto an impossible track that ascends into a stormy sky, surrounded by spectral locomotives made from rusted scrap metal, old voting ballots, and fragments of tribal masks. This surreal scene unfolds at the twilight junction where a decaying colonial-era station meets a vibrant, otherworldly savanna, where the tracks are laid upon spines of old books and the telegraph wires are strung with forgotten prayers. In the atmospheric style of Wangechi Mutu's collaged surrealism and the mystical realism of Ben Enwonwu, blending intricate detail with profound symbolic weight. Book cover framing, centered and monumental composition viewed from a low, reverent angle, emphasizing the colossal scale of the ghost trains against the human figure. Dramatic, volumetric lighting from a setting sun that breaks through purple storm clouds, casting long, haunting shadows and illuminating the scene in a palette of burnt sienna, deep indigo, oxidized copper, and ethereal gold. masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev."
